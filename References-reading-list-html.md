Working With Administrative Data Training Course - References

Materials complied by Zhiqiang Feng, Lynne Forrest, Beata Nowok and Ben Matthews.

Welcome!

We (Zhiqiang, Lynne, Beata and Ben) originally compiled these resources whilst writing the ADRC-Scotland course Working with Administrative Data in 2017. The practical side of the course focused on data manipulation, visualization and the potential pitfalls specific to analysing routinely collected data in the social sciences. We have since run the course again and have updated the list below with additional materials we discussed with participants on the 2018 edition of the course.
You can see the course website at http://adrc-s-intro-to-data-linkage-course.weebly.com/.
What follows is a pretty exhaustive list (we don’t expect course participants to read everything on here!), so a good place to start are the course texts. We ran the course covering both R (https://www.r-project.org/) and Stata (https://www.stata.com/), so we have course texts listed for both programs.
Much of the R material in the course was based on Grolemund and Wickham’s R for Data Science (2017), and a number of chapters from this book are listed under the course topics below.
The Stata side of the course drew on a wider range of materials, and so we’ve selected two as course ‘texts’ - the Introduction to Stata by UNC Carolina Population Centre and Stata Corp’s Resources for learning Stata. The latter of these isn’t a text as such, but is a great place to find information on how to get things done in Stata.
